Built a machine learning model to predict if a person will default on a loan.

Cleaned and prepared the data, converted text values into numbers, and scaled features for better results.

Balanced the dataset using SMOTETomek to make predictions fair.

Trained and compared models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost.

Evaluated results using F1-score, ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.

Selected Logistic Regression as the final model for its  recall and accuracy  for  easy explanation.

Deployed the model on Hugging Face Spaces, making it available as an interactive web app.
